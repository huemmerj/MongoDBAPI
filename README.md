# MongoDB API with ExpressJs Template

This Project can be used to write a Simple RestAPI using express.js with an MongoDB Database. It also supports nested Resources (like here in this example the User has multiple Items)
For creating a new Resource you just need to have a look at the example i provided in this project.

The Key of this project was to build a Library which i can use for building RestAPIs with a MondoDB Backend in a very fast time.
